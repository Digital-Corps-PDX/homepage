          Portland Digital Corps is a volunteer-powered initiative matching local designers, developers, and digital professionals with nonprofits and public-serving orgs to fix small but meaningful digital challenges—quickly.

          Whether it’s fixing an outdated website, improving a form, or making your tools more usable, our goal is to scope, build, and deliver something valuable in a short amount of time. We focus on work that’s impactful, clearly scoped, and actually doable—no open-ended wishlists, no tech hand-waving.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is not an ongoing agency or a new startup. It’s a focused volunteer sprint happening in Spring 2025, inspired by the way civic teams like 18F helped governments ship fast, helpful solutions—and designed for Portland’s nonprofits, mutual aid groups, and public interest orgs.
        </p>
        <p>
          For volunteers, it’s a chance to apply your skills on real teams solving real problems. For orgs, it’s a structured way to get help—from scoping a project to shipping something your community will actually use.
