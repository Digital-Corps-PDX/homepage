          Portland Digital Corps is a short-term civic tech sprint helping nonprofits and mission-driven organizations tackle real digital challenges—without needing to be tech experts themselves.

          Whether your website needs serious love, your digital form is scaring people off, or you just need help understanding what’s broken—our teams of experienced technologists can step in to help.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each project is time-boxed and tightly scoped. Volunteers bring their skills—design, development, research, content, or product management—to help you make tangible improvements, fast.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is not general tech support. We're not here to run your social media, write your grants, or fix your printer. But we <strong>can</strong> help you clarify problems, build or fix small tools, and coach you through digital challenges with empathy and care.
        </p>
        <p>
          Think of it as a digital version of picking up trash along the roadside or reading to kids at the library: a way to use your skills to help others, one small project at a time.
