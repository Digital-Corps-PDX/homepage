# ðŸŒ² Portland Digital Corps Playbook

Welcome to the Portland Digital Corps Playbook â€” a practical guide for volunteers and collaborators joining this short-term civic tech experiment. This isnâ€™t a startup, a nonprofit, or a long-term program. Itâ€™s a focused initiative meant to help real people do real work, right now.

This guide is a living document. Things may change. Weâ€™re sprinting in public.

---

## What This *Is*
- A short-term, volunteer-powered civic tech effort
- Built to match skilled technologists with small orgs who need help
- Focused on impact, not polish â€” useful is the goal

## What This *Isnâ€™t*
- A permanent team or full-service agency
- A branding, marketing, or long-term maintenance firm
- A funnel for recruiting or startup ventures

---

## Values
- **Respect the people** â€” Whether orgs or volunteers, assume good intent and give folks the benefit of the doubt.
- **Keep it real** â€” Scope small. Be honest about what can be done.
- **Build trust** â€” Follow through. Document well. Leave things better.
- **Stay light** â€” No heavy process. No unnecessary forms.

---

## Getting Started ðŸŒ²

**New to the Corps?** Hereâ€™s what to do next:

1. **Attend an Info Session** (virtual or in-person)
2. **Fill out the Volunteer Form** (or just email us if you're unclear)
3. **Weâ€™ll be in touch about team formation**

---

## Working Model (WIP)
- Projects run in **4â€“8 week sprints**
- Volunteers are matched to projects based on skill, interest, and availability
- Each project has a point of contact or rotating lead
- Teams meet weekly (virtually or IRL depending on needs)
- Weâ€™ll document and hand off all deliverables clearly

---

## Tools (Currently Evaluating)
We're not committing to a stack yet. For now:
- Email: [contact@digitalcorpspdx.org](mailto:contact@digitalcorpspdx.org)
- Slack/Discord/Notion TBD

If you have strong feelings or capacity to help set up low-cost tools, let us know.

---

## Contribution Guidelines
If you're jumping into this, know that your time is deeply appreciated. We:
- Welcome folks of all experience levels
- Expect basic collaboration skills (listening, clarity, communication)
- Donâ€™t gatekeep â€” but do try to match people thoughtfully

If youâ€™re unsure how to help: just email us. Weâ€™ll help you find your lane.

---

## Leadership & Ops
This started with Ron â€” but it canâ€™t run on one person alone. Weâ€™ll build light-touch roles around coordination, onboarding, and team support.

If you're interested in helping keep the lights on behind the scenes, raise your hand ðŸŒ²
