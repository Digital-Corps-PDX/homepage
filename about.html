        <p>
          Founded in 2025, Portland Digital Corps is a temporary civic tech sprint aimed at helping local organizations solve immediate digital problems with the help of skilled volunteers.
        </p>

        <p>
          This idea was born out of a simple realization: lots of people want to use their time and expertise to help others. Some pick up litter, some donate to mutual aid, and some of us fix broken forms, bad interfaces, or outdated web tools. If you're not sure how to get involved—or where to offer your time and skills—this effort provides a lightweight, structured way to do just that.
        </p>

        <p>
          Our teams are made up of professionals from design, development, research, and product backgrounds—many of us with experience in civic tech, government service, and nonprofit delivery. We use tested methods (inspired by 18F and the U.S. Digital Service) to move fast, collaborate well, and deliver solutions that leave people better off than when we started.
        </p>

        <p>
          We don’t do long-term maintenance, we don’t build things just because they’re trendy, and we’re not here to replace your staff. We <strong>are</strong> here to help scope a thorny digital problem, coach your team on how to tackle it, or even build something small that could make a big difference. 
        </p>

        <p>
          We don’t do:
          <ul>
            <li>Social media management (unless it involves improving your tools)</li>
            <li>Fundraising strategy or stewardship</li>
            <li>General tech support</li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
          This is a volunteer effort. We are not a company, not a nonprofit, and not here to sell you anything. We’re here because we care—and we think that even small improvements in local systems can make life better for everyone.
