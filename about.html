      <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
        Portland Digital Corps is a short-term, volunteer-powered civic tech initiative created in 2025 to help nonprofits and mission-driven organizations in the Portland metro area solve real digital problems—quickly, collaboratively, and effectively.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4 text-pdx-dark">Why this, why now?</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
        This project is a direct response to a moment of transition—not just for me personally, but for our broader digital public service community. After the sunset of <a class="text-pdx-blue hover:text-pdx-dark" href="https://18f.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">18F</a>, where I served as Head of Design, I found myself thinking less about retrospectives and more about action. What can we fix right now, with the time and skills we already have?
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
        Portland Digital Corps is my answer to that question: a local, fast-moving, highly-focused space where skilled technologists can work on small, solvable problems that matter. Whether you're between roles, looking to give back, or just want to use your skills for good, this is a space to roll up your sleeves and get involved.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4 text-pdx-dark">A community-first approach</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
        Volunteering doesn't just mean picking up trash or reading books at the library. Designers, engineers, and technologists have skills that are often in short supply at the very organizations doing the most meaningful community work. This is our way to plug in—without waiting for permission, funding, or perfection.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
        For local organizations, this is a chance to get scoped, hands-on help: maybe your site hasn't been updated in years, your donation form is broken, or you need help understanding whether a tool is worth adopting. We'll work with you to clarify the challenge, develop a short-term plan, and deliver what we can.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
        While we don't offer ongoing support, marketing, or fundraising help, we can often suggest improvements, create prototypes, or help you get unstuck. We'll consider limited coaching and AI-related support on a case-by-case basis—but our focus remains squarely on digital infrastructure and practical improvements.
      </p>
